**Brief: Tackle each of the four tasksbelow. There is a time limit of 30 mins. You are not expected to be able to complete the entire exercise. The produced code does not need to be production-ready but should be in a state that you would be prepared to present and demonstrate to colleagues.**
  
  Localhost URL: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
  
- Successful build & run app
- The page at  [/hello-world'](http://localhost:3000/hello-world) is returning a 404. Resolve the bug.
- Build an API to return forecasted wind speed and direction for the date in three days time based upon an inputted postcode
-- Query Postcodes.io [https://postcodes.io/](https://postcodes.io/)
          |) with the inputted postcode to return the location's lat/long
          br
          |API call - https://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/{POSTCODE}
        li Query MetaWeather Location Search (
          a(href='https://www.metaweather.com/api/#locationsearch' target='_blank') https://www.metaweather.com/api/#locationsearch
          |) with lat/long from above to return Where On Earth ID (woeid)
          br
          |API call - https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?lattlong={LATTITUDE},{LONGTITUDE}
        li Query MetaWeather Location (
          a(href='https://www.metaweather.com/api/#location' target='_blank') https://www.metaweather.com/api/#location
          |) with Where On Earth ID (woeid), filter results by applicable_date for the date in three days time and return wind_speed and wind_direction in a JSON object
          br
          |API call - https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/{WOEID}/
    li Write unit tests for the above
